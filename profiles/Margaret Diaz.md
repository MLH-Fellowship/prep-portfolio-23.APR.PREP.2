## Description
I am a junior at Hunter College majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Spanish. Python is my favorite programming language because I like working the back end. My proudest project is creating an active help-center forum that allows users to add and delete comments my teammates and I completed during an internship at Bitly using React, SQL, and Flask. I hope to add more projects to my portfolio and get better experience using git. Outside of coding, I love completing jigsaw puzzles and catching up on the latest show!
