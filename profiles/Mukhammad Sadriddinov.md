## Description
Hey y'all! 👋🏼 I’m a software engineer who enjoys challenging himself with solving complex problems. Having successfully delivered projects at various organizations 🏢, I am looking for new opportunities and challenges🏄.

I have delivered multi-functional, full-cycle software solutions by leveraging my knowledge in algorithms and problem-solving skills. I have experienced in working with diverse open APIs such as Twitter API 🐦, Google Map API and Movie DB API 🎥. Even though I find myself very proud of when I accomplished something by myself, I do see myself thrived and enjoyed by collaborating with diverse team members🌎 who thrive on challenges and work together to roll out new software daily.

Outside of pressing keys on a computer, I enjoy going on hikes 👟 working out at the gym 🏋🏻‍♂️ and cooking 🍕.
